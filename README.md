# Jquery Server Calculator

## Description
Created a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation. The mathematical result can be calculated and displayed. 

Built out the server-side logic to compute the numbers. The server can handle Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 

Kept a historical record of all math operations and solutions on the server. Display a list of all previous calculations on the page. Update the list when a new calculation is made.
